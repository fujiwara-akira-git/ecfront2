Subject: Add FavoriteProducer table - Please apply SQL

Hi,

Please apply the attached SQL to add the `FavoriteProducer` table to the database. This is a non-destructive change that creates a table and adds indexes and foreign keys.

Files:
- `prisma/sql/add_favorite_producer.sql`  (SQL to execute)
- `prisma/sql/ADMIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md`     (backup & verification steps)

Quick command (psql):

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f prisma/sql/add_favorite_producer.sql
```

After applying, please confirm and notify the developer to run:

```bash
npx prisma db pull
npx prisma generate
```

Thank you.
